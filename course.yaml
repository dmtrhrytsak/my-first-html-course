    description: >-
      HTML is an abbreviation for "hypertext markup language."
      It is a programming language used to construct web pages that can be seen by a web browser.
      The majority of web pages on the internet, including the one you're viewing right now, are saved as HTML files.
      Websites are collections of connected HTML pages that are saved on a server someplace.
      That is why the language is sometimes referred to as the "backbone of the internet."

      HTML is composed of a number of hierarchical components.
      The majority of elements contain an opening and closing tag, with some stuff in between.
      If this is foreign to you, imagine HTML as a tree with elements as its branches.
