# Attributes

Elements can have attributes as well.

```html
<p class="my-dream">When I grow up, I want to be a HTML Developer.</p>
```

Attributes provide additional information about the element that will not display in the content. The `class` attribute in this example is a labeling identifier that is used to target the element for styling purposes.

An attribute should have:

- There should be some spacing between an attribute and an element name.
- The name of the attribute, followed by an equal sign.
- An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.
- An attribute value enclosed in opening and closing quotation marks.

## Adding attributes to an element

`<a>` is another example of an element. This is an anchor. An anchor can convert the text it surrounds into a hyperlink. Anchors can have a variety of characteristics, just a few examples are as follows:

- **`href`**: The value of this attribute indicates the web URL for the link. For instance, `href="https://www.google.com/"`.

- **`title`**: The `title` attribute gives additional information about the link, such as a description of the page to which the link is directed. For example, `title="The thing that knows everything"`. When the cursor hovers over the element, this shows as a tooltip.

- **`target`**: The `target` attribute defines the browsing context in which the link is shown. For instance, `target=" blank"` will open the link in a new tab. Simply leave out this property if you want the given content to appear in the current tab.

Create a link to your favorite website:

1. Add the `<a>` element.
2. Add the `href` attribute and the title attribute.
3. Specify the target attribute to open the link in the new tab.

> ℹ️ Remember that you need to include a space between the element name, and between each attribute.
