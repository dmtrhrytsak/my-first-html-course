# HTML comments

HTML has a means for inserting comments into the code. Browsers disregard comments, keeping them invisible to the user. Comments allow you to insert notes in the code to clarify your reasoning or coding. This is really beneficial if you return to a code base after being away for a long time and don't recall anything. Similarly, comments can be quite useful when different individuals make adjustments and updates.

To leave an HTML comment, use the special markers `<!—-` and `-—>`. As an example:

```html
<p>It sucks because I can't hide.</p>

<!-- <p>Basically, my job is to remain invisible.</p> -->
```

As you will see, only the first paragraph will be displayed on the page.

```
It sucks because I can't hide.
```
