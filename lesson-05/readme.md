# Empty elements

Not all elements correspond to the standard pattern of an opening tag, content, and closing tag. Some elements are made up of a single tag that is usually used to insert/embed something into the page. The `<img>` element, for example, embeds an image file onto a page:

```html
<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/u9pv5.jpg" />
```
