# Anatomy of an HTML element

Let's dig deeper into our previous section's paragraph element:

The element's anatomy is as follows:

```html
<!-- opening tag -->
<p>
  <!-- content -->
  When I grow up, I want to be a HTML Developer.
</p>
<!-- closing tag -->
```

- **The opening tag** is made up of the element's name (in this case, `p` for paragraph) enclosed by opening `<` and closing `<` angle brackets. This opening tag indicates where the element begins. In this instance, it goes before the beginning of the paragraph text.

- **The element's content** is the paragraph text in this specific instance.

- **The closing tag** is similar to the opening tag, except it contains a forward slash before the element name. This indicates the end of the element. Forgetting to add a closing tag is a typical novice mistake that might result in strange effects.

> ℹ️ The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.
