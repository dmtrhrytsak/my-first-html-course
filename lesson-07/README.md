# Boolean attributes

Attributes are sometimes written without values. This is perfectly okay. These are known as boolean attributes. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is usually the same as the name of the attribute. Consider the disabled property, which may be applied to form input elements. (We use this to prevent the user from entering data into the form input elements.)

```html
<input type="text" disabled="disabled" />
```

It is allowed to write this as a shorthand:

```html
<input type="text" disabled />
```
