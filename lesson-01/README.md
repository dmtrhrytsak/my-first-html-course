# What exactly is HTML?

HTML is a markup language that instructs web browsers how to construct the web pages you see. It may be as complex or as basic as the website developer desires. HTML is made up of elements that you may utilize to enclose, wrap, or mark up distinct bits of material to make them appear or behave in a certain way. The enclosing tags can convert content into a hyperlink that leads to another website, italicize words, and so on. Imagine the following text:

```
When I grow up, I want to be a HTML Developer.
```

We indicate that the text is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph `<p>` tag:

```html
<p>When I grow up, I want to be a HTML Developer.</p>
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **_NOTE:_** HTML does not give a damn about the case of letters. Meaning that they can be written in either uppercase or lowercase letters. A `<article>` tag, for example, can be written as `<article>`, `<ARTICLE>`, `<ArTiClE>`, and so on, and it will work just fine. But even so, for consistency and readability, all tags should be written in lowercase.

## What time is it? It's time to practice! üïí

1. Populate a paragraph element `<p>` with the following: `Hello, HTML!`.
